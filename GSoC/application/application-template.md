## 1. Personal statement

### 1.1 Motivation: Why this project?
Explain what draws you to this particular project. Which technical, scientific, or community-related aspects make it appealing to you? Describe how the project aligns with your academic background, professional goals, or personal interests. You should also reflect on the potential value of this work for the broader open-source ecosystem and how you see your contribution making a meaningful impact.
  
### 1.2 Past experience
Summarize your previous experience that is applicable to this project. This may include programming skills, prior involvement in open-source communities, research activities, coursework, or professional experience. If you have contributed to open-source projects, published papers, built libraries, or created technical content, be sure to highlight these and clarify your role and responsibilities.    

### 1.3 Match: why you?
Articulate why you are a strong candidate for this project. What distinguishes you from other applicants? Discuss specific skills, perspectives, or experiences that position you well to successfully execute the proposed work and engage with the community. If you have worked on related problems or technologies before, explain how that experience prepares you for this project.

### 1.4 Expectations
Indicate whether you have any particular expectations regarding the role of the mentors or the support provided through the GSoC program. If applicable, outline the type of guidance, feedback, or resources you consider important for successfully carrying out the project.
    
### 1.4 Availability
Clearly state your availability during the GSoC coding period. List any other commitments you expect, such as academic obligations, employment, or planned vacations. If applicable, explain how you intend to manage these alongside your GSoC responsibilities to ensure consistent progress and engagement.

## 2. Project Proposal
#### 2.1 Abstract 
Provide a concise overview of the proposed work, outlining what will be developed and why it is relevant. Describe the background, practical or technical drivers that led to the formulation of this proposal. Clearly state the primary objective of the work, emphasizing the outcome it aims to achieve and the value it is expected to add.

### 2.2 Implementation Plan 
Outline how you plan to execute the project. This section should focus on what will be delivered and how progress will be structured. 
Please include: 
* Core deliverables. A concise bullet-point list of the minimum set of features, components, or outputs that define a successful project. 
* Stretch goals (optional). Additional tasks, improvements, or extensions that could be pursued if time allows. These should be clearly marked as non-essential.

### 2.3 Timeline and Milestones 
Provide a high-level timeline covering the full GSoC period. Break the project into logical phases and associate each phase with concrete milestones and expected outcomes. The timeline should include: 
* **Community Bonding Period.** Onboarding activities, environment setup, codebase familiarization, and refinement of the project plan in coordination with mentors. 
* **Coding Phase 1.** Initial implementation of core components and early deliverables. 
* **Midterm Evaluation Milestone.** Clearly specify what functionality or results will be completed by the midterm evaluation. 
* **Coding Phase 2.** Completion of remaining core deliverables, integration, testing, and documentation. 
* **Final Evaluation Milestone.** Finalized implementation, code cleanup, documentation, and any optional stretch goals if time permits. 

_Tip: Milestones should be realistic, measurable, and aligned with GSoC evaluation checkpoints._

## 3. Communication Plan
Describe how you intend to stay in regular contact with your mentor throughout the project. Specify the expected cadence of interactions, distinguishing between brief check-ins and more in-depth discussions. Indicate which communication platforms you plan to use for synchronous and asynchronous exchanges, and explain how these channels will support timely feedback, progress tracking, and coordination over the course of the project.

## Appendix (Optional)
Any other information you want us to know that does not fit elsewhere.
