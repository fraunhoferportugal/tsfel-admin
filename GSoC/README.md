As part of your GSoC application, you are required to submit a project proposal. This page provides documentation and guidelines on how to prepare a strong proposal to work with us.

## Rules

When preparing your application or contributing to TSFEL, candidates are expected to follow a set of conduct and contribution standards. Failure to comply with these guidelines may negatively affect how mentors assess your application and can lead to disqualification.

- Ensure that you are [eligible](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/get-started) to participate in GSoC 2026.
- Review the GSoC 2026 [timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline).
- Review the available [project list](https://github.com/fraunhoferportugal/tsfel-admin/blob/main/GSoC/projects/gsoc-2026-projects.md). If you have specific questions about a project, contact us on Slack.
- Read the Google Summer of Code [DOs and DON’Ts](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2011/03/dos-and-donts-of-google-summer-of-code.html).
- Applications and code contributions must reflect your own work. Excessive reliance on automated content-generation tools is discouraged and may result in rejection.
- Any external code used must fully comply with its license terms. You are responsible for verifying that reuse is permitted and for clearly acknowledging original authors where required. Even when reuse is allowed, maintainers may still request a clean reimplementation.

## Application Submission Process

Prospective contributors must submit their project proposals through the official GSoC platform during the submission window (March 16–31).

The submission must include:
1. A CV with contact information.
2. A project proposal document following the required structure.❗Check the structure template [here](https://github.com/fraunhoferportugal/tsfel-admin/blob/main/GSoC/application/application-template.md)❗

The project proposal document must:
- Be submitted as a single PDF file.
- Use standard body text with a 10pt or 12pt font size, and appropriately scaled headings.
- Follow a clean, professional layout (margins, spacing, and sectioning should prioritize readability).
- Have a total length of 4 to 10 pages, inclusive of figures and tables, and excluding references.

Applicants are expected to carefully review their final submission. Common issues in past applications include formatting errors, incomplete sections, broken links, and typographical mistakes.
