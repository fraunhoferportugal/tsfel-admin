##  Rules

When preparing your application or contribution to TSFEL, candidates are expected to adhere to a set of conduct and contribution standards. Ignoring these guidelines can negatively affect how mentors assess your engagement and may lead to disqualification from the selection process.

* Applications and code contributions must reflect your own work. Overreliance on automated content generation tools is discouraged and may lead to rejection.
* Any external code incorporated into your work must be used in full compliance with its licensing terms. You are responsible for verifying that reuse is permitted and for clearly acknowledging the original authors where applicable. Even when reuse is allowed, maintainers may still require a clean reimplementation.
* Contributions should be aligned with issues explicitly marked for newcomer or GSoC-related work. Opening pull requests outside these categories should only be done after prior discussion with maintainers or issue authors.


##  Application Submission Process

Prospective contributors must submit their project proposals through the official GSocC platform within the designated submission window (March 16-31). All proposals aiming to contribute to TSFEL must follow the designated GSoC application structure. The following formatting and submission requirements apply:

* Applications must be submitted as a single PDF document, use standard body text, and use a 10pt or 12pt font size, with headings scaled appropriately. Layout choices (margins, spacing, and sectioning) should support readability and professional presentation.
* The total length of the proposal should fall between 4 and 10 pages, inclusive of figures, tables, and excluding references.
* Applicants are expected to carefully review their final document before submission. Common issues in past applications have included formatting problems, incomplete sections, broken hyperlinks, and typographical errors.
