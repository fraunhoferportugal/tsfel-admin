# GSoC 2026 Project Ideas

``TSFEL`` is a mature, open-source Python library for efficient and reproducible feature extraction from time-series data. The GitHub repository is [here](https://github.com/fraunhoferportugal/tsfel), which contains links to our project documentation and communication channels.

It provides a well-documented, actively maintained collection of feature extraction methods spanning the **statistical**, **temporal**, **spectral**, and **fractal** domains, and is used by research groups and applied projects worldwide.

``TSFEL`` offers GSoC contributors:

- A stable and production-ready codebase  
- Direct mentorship from long-term maintainers  

The library’s modular design and decorator-based feature system make it particularly well suited for **scoped, incremental contributions** that fit within the GSoC timeline. All projects are mentored by active `TSFEL` maintainers and are designed to deliver reusable functionality that will hopefully remain part of the library well beyond the GSoC period.

The projects presented here are our selected proposals for Google Summer of Code 2026. Additional details for each project are provided below.
